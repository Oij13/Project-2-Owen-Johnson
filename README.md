This project provided me with experience implementing a BST for a large list of users. The simpler aspects of the project included creating the basic constructors, which were done in class but were review anyway. The starter code for the BST testing class was also easy to implement since it only took a little bit of manipulation to get it working from project one. I found it difficult to get the retire employee classes to work, as a misplacement of an object caused the user to not get deleted, causing me debugging headaches down the line. This experience was challenging yet educational towards building my algorithm visualization capacity and allowing me to practice recursion as well.
